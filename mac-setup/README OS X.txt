S2 Statistics Package v2.1 Beta 2 

OS X version for x86_64 platform Macs


Website for bug reports, feature requests, etc:	http://code.google.com/p/salstat-statistics-package-2/


------ Installation Notes: ----------

1)	To use this program, unzip the S2.app bundle and drag to your /Applications folder.
2)	If you receive a message from Gate Keeper on OS X Mountain Lion machines regarding this application being unsigned,
	Just right-click S2.app and select "Open". You should only have to do this the first time.


------- Know Bugs: ------------------

1)	The font change dialog will not remain on screen when opened.


------- Future Version Notes: -------

1)	We will create a .DMG drag'n'drop installer.
2)	If you wish to run S2 on other Mac platforms, it should run fine from source code (either download the source code 
	package, or clone our Mercurial repository. It has been tested on 64 bit Mountain Lion, and 32-bit Snow Leopard and Lion
	using either Mac Ports, or the Enthought Python Distribution.)
3)	Help and documentation will be coming in future versions.
