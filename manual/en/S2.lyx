Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Welcome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the manual for the S2 statistics package which is actively developed
 by the S2 team.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this introduction we will commence by discussing the history of the S2
 project.
 We will then discuss the aims of the project, and some of our future developmen
t goals.
 From the outset, we want to stress that this is an open source project,
 and we really want to hear from people who try our software.
 Please feel more than welcome to go to the project homepage which can be
 found at

 and to use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Issues
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 section to leave us comments on any defects you may find, and suggestions
 for future enhancements.
 There are also contact details so you may send us email if you prefer to!
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an open source project released under the terms of the GPL license, you
 are free to install and use S2 on any computer you want to.
 we also welcome you to contribute to S2 if you have any skills you feel
 like offering, whether it be coding, documentation, adding tips to the
 Wiki, or any of a number of other possibilities.
 We would be most grateful for any help you are able to provide on a one
 off basis, or ongoing! In particular, we would welcome people who can contribut
e by helping to translate S2 to other languages.
 Also, we would welcome users who can test S2 on platforms that the developers
 do not have access to.
 If something does not look nice visually on your computer, let us know
 and we will try to improve it where possible.

\begin_layout Section
Project History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand where S2 has come from, we have to go back 2002 and discuss
 a program called SalStat which was initiated by Dr.
 Alan James Salmoni Ph.D.
 He was teaching undergraduate Psychology students and realised that SPSS
 would not run on his computer (This was at a time when computers were much
 more costly than they are now, and had limited processor speeds, memory,
 and hard disk capacity.
 Since he was an Information Technology graduate, he set about doing what
 IT graduates do -- coding a solution to his problem! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since his Ph.D.
 was in the area of User Experience (nowadays referred to as UX,) he was
 very aware of making a program what could be used on different platforms
 (Windows, Mac, Linux,) and that had a User Interface that was able to be
 used by students who were not computer experts, but who needed reasonably
 comprehensive Statistical routines (his Psychology undergraduates.) After
 examining his options, he chose to use Python 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

www.python.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as his language of choice, and to use the already well established wxWindows
 (now called wxWidgets) 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

www.wxwidgets.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

 GUI library which has been ported to Python as the wxPython 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

www.wxpython.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

 software library.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even in those days, intellectual property was a big issue of the day.
 As Dr.
 Salmoni did not want to have to deal with support and commercial marketing
 issues, he decided to use the GNU General Public License (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GPL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) which he felt protected his intellectual property in a way that no other
 license did at the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having sorted out these issues, he got out his text editor, and did what
 programmers do -- he opened a fresh file named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

salstat.py
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and started writing code! Between approximately 2002 and early 2004 he
 continued to code what became named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

SalStat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and released his source code through the huge online open source repository
 SourceForge.
 These efforts can still be found at 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 today.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to his teaching commitments, and because he had a good working program
 at this point, Dr.
 Salmoni stopped working on SalStat early in 2004 but the fruits of his
 labours continued to be downloaded by people wanting statistics software.
 It was about this time that there was a fork in SalStat's road which, unknowing
ly, led to it being developed in two different directions!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over in South America, in Colombia, around early 2004, a young Chemical
 Engineer named Sebastian LÃ³pez needed some statistical software, and decided
 to teach himself his first programming language.
 He found SalStat, and his programming language of choice become Python!
 Following long tradition, Sebastian forked SalStat (the process by which
 you take an existing program and begin development independent of the original
 developer.) Sebastian then worked alone on his version of SalStat, losing
 touch with Dr.
 Salmoni, and the original SalStat development (which had stalled / ceased.)
 At some point, he opened a project on the Google Code repository which
 is the current project home site at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://code.google.com/p/salstat-statistics-package-2/
\end_layout

\end_inset

 where you can now find it.
 However, in the interests of history, we should tell what happened in the
 mean time back in the original SalStat fork.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In early 2007 your author (Mark Livingstone) was a mature age undergraduate
 at Griffith University on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia studying
 part time towards his Bachelor of Information Technology.
 With an interest in Bioinformatics (combining Science and Information technolog
y,) he decided to try the Biostatistics course being offered by the Medical
 Science School.
 As an aid to learning, and because SPSS is not exactly something you could
 download and hack on at home, he looked online for some statistical software
 to be able to study the code for the statistical algorithms.
 He found the abandoned SalStat and contacted Dr.
 Salmoni who was more than happy for someone to work at bringing SalStat
 uptodate (3 years being a long time in the computer software world!) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the years as time permitted, Mark worked by fixing bugs, adding new
 statistical routines, and upgrading the user interface to current standards.
 In particular, Mark had been bitten early by the Macintosh bug and worked
 hard to make SalStat work well, and look gorgeous on the Macintosh platform
 which had recently started to be made with Intel processors.
 This continued until one day in mid-2012 when Mark typed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

SalStat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into Google and discovered an entry for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Salstat 2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over on the Google Code site!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Mark looked at Sebastian's Salstat 2 program, it was obvious that Sebastian
 was programming at a much faster rate! It looked good from screenshots,
 and had far more functionality than Mark had, so it was decided to combine
 efforts.
 Mark has joined Sebastian and is working to port over all of his work,
 and in particular to make what has now been renamed as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

S2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the code base going forward.
 The source code on Sourceforge continues to be downloaded as it still has
 some functionality not yet available in S2 (for example Printing), but
 this will change in the near future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, this is how things came to be as they are now.
 Sebastian and Mark are working hard on the next releases that we have planned
 -- and invite you to join us if you have some time to spare! While statistics
 often has a dry and uninviting feel to it, and most people don't like anything
 that relates to maths, we and S2 are not like that at all.
 The S2 development team are having fun and invite you to join us!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we know how history transpired, and S2 came about, let us quickly
 summarise some of what S2 can do for you, so that you can decide if it
 is what you are looking for.
