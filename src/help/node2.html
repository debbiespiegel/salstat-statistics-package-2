History of SalStat</A>
</H1>

<P>
The idea for SalStat began forming in my mind a number of years ago
when I realised that SPSS would not run on my computer (it was a small
one with a small memory by todays standards). Over time, I got a more
powerful computer that could run SPSS, but I couldn't afford it, and
later on, I actually taught psychology undergraduates how to use SPSS
for basic statistical analysis (up to multi-factorial analysis of
variance). Every time I taught, the same problems came up again and
again: For example. the data entry was confusing and varied according
to whether you were performing a within or between subjects test.
This was confusing to people who weren't familiar with SPSS or even
statistics, and I felt that it got in the way of how productive the
students were. In addition, my colleagues and myself relied greatly
upon the top commercial packages and found them all lacking in some
way or other, which gave me an ``itch'' that I had to scratch.

<P>
Therefore, I saw that there was a need for a simple and easy to use
statistics package available on as many different operating systems
as possible which could be used by virtually anyone with a little
bit of statistical knowledge. This created a few problems in itself.
Obviously, in order to be easy to use, it had to have a graphic user
interface (GUI) as many people find the command line interface intimidating.
Besides, there are already good packages available with the command
line interface (such as R or lisp-stat - see appendix C for more details).
GUI programming is difficult to do across different platforms, as
they all do things in different ways. This meant either that I had
to write a new version of SalStat for each platform (which was difficult
as I didn't have a MacIntosh to work on), or I had to use a language
that offered cross-platform capabilities with a powerful yet simple
way to do a GUI interface. For example, Visual Basic would allow me
to do the program on Windows easily, but it would not be available
for Unix, Linux or the MacIntosh.

<P>
I considered many languages. My first choice was Ada, a language commissioned
by the US Department of Defense. It was cross-platform, was compiled
(which makes the program faster), and was a rock-solid language in
terms of reliability (it is used in things like avionics and missile
guidance systems). However, GUI programming was difficult as the only
truly cross-platform interface was the Tk toolkit which didn't offer
all that I wanted from a GUI. My next consideration was Object Pascal,
a version of Pascal by Borland, but that ran only on Windows (Delphi)
and Linux (Kylix) which meant no program for the other Unices and
MacIntosh. I also briefly considered C or C++, but programmers on
these languages seemed to spend most of their time debugging memory
problems than anything, and I wanted a working package more than a
programming challenge.

<P>
Finally I settled on the Python language. Python is a modern object
oriented language that had a reputation for being easy to use. Its
syntax was clear and interpreters were available for most platforms
around. Not only did it offer the possibility of running programs
on Unix, Linux, MacIntosh and Windows, but it also had good cross-platform
GUI toolkits. The standard was called Tkinter, based upon Tk, but
I decided not to use that due to the non-standard widgets (widgets
are things like buttons and edit boxes). The best option left to me
was a toolkit called wxPython. At the time, it wasn't available for
the MacIntosh, but work was progressing on it, and I hoped that it
would be ready by the time SalStat was finished. wxPython offered
me all the GUI widgets that I needed (and then some!), along with
native look and feel, and a simple object oriented way of programming
them.

<P>
My decision to use the GNU General Public License (the ``GPL'') for
this work was for pragmatic reasons. If had had released it under
a commercial/proprietary license, I would have to offer support and
do some marketing which is not something I am interested in. My objective
was not to make money, but rather to make the best statistics package
that I could, and the GPL offered me protection of my intellectual
property in a way that no other license did. In addition, being open
source, I was more likely to get people involved in contributing towards
the project which would enable the code to be made more solid over
time.

<P>
Since then, SalStat has come along in leaps and bounds. I have had
some feedback of a number of kind people all around the world, and
I find it heartening that folk from so many different countries find
my work useful.

<P>
To date, I have heard from people in: UK, Ireland, US, Canada, Slovakia,
France, Germany, Switzerland, the Phillipines, Australia, Brazil,
and I think in Mexico too. I am interested in hearing how many people
use it, so drop me an email if you can.
