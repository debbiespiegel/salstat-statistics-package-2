Analysing 3 Sample Tests</A>
</H1>

<P>
3 or more sample tests are used when you have 3 or more samples -
quite simple really! For example, we could expand the above experiment
with alcohol and reaction time by having more than 2 different levels
of alcohol - let's say the first level would be no alcohol (zero units),
the second would be 2 units and the third would be 4 units. This means
that there would be three conditions in the experiment.

<P>

<P>
To analyse this kind of experimental design, you might consider using
a t test, firstly to compare 0 units against 2 units, then 2 units
against 4 units, then again to compare 0 units to 4 units. That way
you would be comparing all the conditions against each other.

<P>
However, in reality you would not be able to do this because you would
be analysing the same set of data three times. Because statistics
is based upon, well, statistics, the chance of your getting a significant
result increases each time you analyse a set of data, which increases
the likelihood of there being a Type I error - when a significant
result is found (and the null hypothesis rejected) when there wasn't
really a significant result in the first place.

<P>
When you have more than 3 conditions, you need to use other tests,
and probably the most famous (and in the authors experience, the most
used) test is the ``analysis of variance'' (or anova for short). This
test will allow you to compare a large number of conditions with each
other, and tell you whether any of them differ significantly.

<P>
The problem with anova is that they don't actually tell you where
the significant difference is, they only tell you whether one exists,
and there are ways to find out where the difference lies but that
will be explained later in the section.

<P>
The anova is for parametric data. If you have non parametric data,
there are equivalents that you can use with SalStat: The Kruskal-Wallis
H test, and the Friedman Chi Square, both of which act like a non-parametric
anova, but SalStat deals with them in the same way. The Kruskal-Wallis
H test is for between subjects designs and the Friedman test is for
within subjects designs.

<P>
Once you have entered your data, click on the ``analyse'' menu, then
select ``3+ Sample Tests...'' for the appropriate dialog to appear.
This dialog is a bit different from the other 2 test dialogs that
you have encountered (assuming that you have followed this book in
a linear order of course), but the main difference is that you will
not select which columns you want to analyse by using drop down boxes
- this is because there may be more than 2 columns you want to analyse.
Instead, you have a check list to select your columns, rather like
the dialog box that appeared when you wanted to get a set of descriptive
statistics. Only columns with data will appear there, and to select
one, all you have to do is click on the box to the columns left and
it will be selected (click again to de-select it).

<P>
Like the other test dialogs, there is a list of descriptive statistics
to the right hand side and you can select which ever ones you want
(if you want any of course which is usually a good idea). The next
thing to do is select which test you want - again using a check list
box (perhaps SalStat should be called ``CheckListStat'' instead?),
and finally select which hypothesis you want.

<P>
SalStat differs from other statistics packages by allowing you to
choose mutually exclusive tests: You can choose an anova for within
or between subjects, and get the non parametric equivalents at the
same time. This might not be orthodox operation for statistics packages,
but let's face it - if you wanted to analyse the same set of data
using different tests, you could do so anyway, but it would just take
longer. SalStat allows you to cheat in a more efficient manner, and
leaves the decisions up to you.

<P>
Okay, so you have done all you need to do: Selected the columns you
want to analyse (necessary), chosen the test (not necessary, but if
you don't, there will be no results to look at), and chosen the hypothesis
(one or two tailed). Optionally, you have a list of descriptive statistics
to choose from, but that's your choice. The next thing to do is click
on the ``okay'' button.

<P>
Wait a short while (depending upon how large your set of data is),
and the results should appear in the output window. The results for
an anova differ slightly from the other tests in that they show a
lot more information. You should be shown a table where the first
column lists the factor you are analysing, the error, and the total.
The next column shows the Sum of Squares (SS) for each factor, then
the degrees of freedom (df) followed by the Mean Square (MS). These
are of interest, but the main thing for you to look at now are the
last 2 columns. The first of these is titled ``F'', and this is your
test statistics. If it is less than 1.0, then it will not be significant
no matter what your data look like. The final column lists the p-value,
and you should be aiming for a p of less than 0.05 (or 5%) which
means you have a significant result.

<P>
The Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis H tests do not have as much detail
as the anova which shows a table with the degrees of freedom, sums
of squares and so on.
